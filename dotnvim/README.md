# Hamled's dotvim for Neovim
This is a complete from-scratch rebuild based on my dotvim for Vim, which is a very minor fork from [bling's dotvim](https://github.com/bling/dotvim).

Bling's dotvim is awesome and gives a very complete setup that's very easy to get started with. However I want to take the opportunity presented by switching to Neovim, to define my configuration from scratch and include only the pieces I need.

This setup should be significantly simpler as well because it will not be designed all of the of pieces to be configurable. Instead, I'll only add in the pieces that I know I have a need for, when I need them.
